-- Conditionals 1.
--
-- Conditions are like questions. They allow a program to decide to take one
-- action if the answer to a question is "true" or to do
-- another action if the answer to the question is "false."
--
-- The questions asked within a program are always logical or
-- relational statements. For example, if the variable 'i' is equal
-- to zero then draw a line.

import Graphics.Proc

main = runProc $ def { procSetup = setup, procDraw = draw }

width  = 640
height = 360

setup = do
  size (P2 width height)

draw ()  = do
	background (grey 0)

	forM_ [10, 20 .. width] $ \i -> do
		if (int i `mod` 20 == 0)
			then do
				stroke (grey 255)
				line (P2 i 80) (P2 i (height / 2))
			else do
				stroke (grey 153)
				line (P2 i 20) (P2 i 180)


----------------------------------
-- Side note
--
-- We could easily transform imperative if-statment to pure one.
-- We can create a procedure that takes in color and the length
-- of the line and pass values that are based on condition.
