-- The angle of each segment is controlled with the mouseX and mouseY position.
-- The transformations applied to the first segment are also applied to the
-- second segment because they are inside the same pushMatrix() and popMatrix() group.

-- Side note
--
-- The rotate in processing varies in the interval [0, 2*pi]
-- But in the haskell lib the angle of rotation is measured in TAUs
-- It's a ratio of full rotation. So the interval is [0, 1].
