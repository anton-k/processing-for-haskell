-- Click on the window to give it focus and press the letter keys to type colors.
-- The keyboard function keyPressed() is called whenever a key is pressed. keyReleased()
-- is another keyboard function that is called when a key is released.

-- Side note
--
-- This example demonstrates how not only Haskell can borrow from Processing,
-- but how Processing can use advanced features of Haskell
--
-- We use associative map from letters to colors. No need to encode all collections with arrays.
