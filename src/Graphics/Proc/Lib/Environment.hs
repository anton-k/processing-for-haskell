-- | Return the pair of width and height as a 2D vector.
winSize :: Pio P2
winSize = liftA2 P2 winWidth winHeight

-- | System variable that stores the width of the display window.
-- This value is set by the first parameter of the @size()@ function.
-- For example, the function call @size(320, 240)@ sets the width
-- variable to the value 320. The value of width defaults to 100
-- if @size()@ is not used in a program.

winWidth :: Pio Float
winWidth  = liftIO $ fmap (fromIntegral . fst) getWindowSize

-- | System variable that stores the height of the display window.
-- This value is set by the second parameter of the @winSize()@ function.
-- For example, the function call @winSize(320, 240)@ sets the height
-- variable to the value 240. The value of height defaults to 100
-- if @winSize()@ is not used in a program.

winHeight = liftIO $ fmap (fromIntegral . snd) getWindowSize

--------------------------------------------

-- | Defines the dimension of the display window width and height
-- in units of pixels. In a program that has the setup() function,
-- the size() function must be the first line of code inside setup().

size :: P2 -> Draw
size = liftIO . glSize

--------------------------------------------

-- | Draws all geometry with smooth (anti-aliased) edges. This behavior is
-- the default, so @smooth()@ only needs to be used when a program needs to set
-- the smoothing in a different way. The level parameter increases the level
-- of smoothness. This is the level of over sampling applied to the graphics buffer.

smooth :: Draw
smooth = liftIO $ pointSmooth $= Enabled

-- | Draws all geometry and fonts with jagged (aliased) edges and images
-- when hard edges between the pixels when enlarged rather than interpoloating pixels.
-- Note that smooth() is active by default, so it is necessary to call noSmooth()
-- to disable smoothing of geometry, fonts, and images.
--
-- processing docs: <https://processing.org/reference/noSmooth_.html>
noSmooth :: Pio ()
noSmooth = liftIO $ pointSmooth $= Disabled

-- | Specifies the number of frames to be displayed every second.
-- For example, the function call frameRate(30) will attempt to
-- refresh 30 times a second. If the processor is not fast enough to
-- maintain the specified rate, the frame rate will not be achieved.
-- Setting the frame rate within setup() is recommended.
-- The default rate is 60 frames per second.

frameRate :: Float -> Pio ()
frameRate = putFrameRate


-- | Executes the code within draw() one time. This functions allows the program
-- to update the display window only when necessary, for example when an event
-- registered by mousePressed() or keyPressed() occurs.
--
-- In structuring a program, it only makes sense to call redraw() within events
-- such as mousePressed(). This is because redraw() does not run draw() immediately
-- (it only sets a flag that indicates an update is needed).

redraw :: Draw
redraw = putLoopMode Redraw

-- | By default, Processing loops through draw() continuously, executing the code
-- within it. However, the draw() loop may be stopped by calling noLoop().
-- In that case, the draw() loop can be resumed with loop().
--
-- processing docs: <https://processing.org/reference/loop_.html>
loop :: Draw
loop = putLoopMode Loop

-- | Stops Processing from continuously executing the code within draw().
-- If loop() is called, the code in draw() begins to run continuously again.
-- If using noLoop() in setup(), it should be the last line inside the block.
