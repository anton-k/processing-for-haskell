-- | Modifies the location from which ellipses are drawn by changing the way in which parameters given to ellipse() are intepreted.
--
-- The default mode is @ellipseMode Center@, which interprets the first two parameters of ellipse() as the shape's center point, while the third and fourth parameters are its width and height.
--
-- @ellipseMode Radius@ also uses the first two parameters of ellipse() as the shape's center point, but uses the third and fourth parameters to specify half of the shapes's width and height.
--
-- @ellipseMode Corner@ interprets the first two parameters of ellipse() as the upper-left corner of the shape, while the third and fourth parameters are its width and height.
--
-- @ellipseMode Corners@ interprets the first two parameters of ellipse() as the location of one corner of the ellipse's bounding box, and the third and fourth parameters as the location of the opposite corner.

-- | Modifies the location from which rectangles are drawn by changing the way in which parameters given to rect() are intepreted.
